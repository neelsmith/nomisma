In the `tables` directory of this repository:


-  `mintpoints.csv` contains longitude-latitude points for mints named in *IGCH*.  It is generated by applying `utils/csvForMintGeo.sc` to the numerous (more than 15,000) rdf files for `nomisma.org` identifiers in the `ids` directory.


## In development

Tabular data files for *OCRE* data sets, summarizing:

-   basic information for each type, comprising `id#label#denomination#material#authority#mint#region`
-   an expanded table joining to each row `obverse type#obverse legend#obverse portrait#reverse type#reverse legend#reverse portrait`
