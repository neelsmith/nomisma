The freely reusable numismatic data sets from `nomisma.org` are invaluable resources.  The dowloadable data sets are in RDF format, which is good for some things, but not for everything.  The `nomsima` library allows you to read RDF data from `nomisma.org` and work with it from high-level models in Scala code, or to covert it to delimited text files for use with statistical packages, GIS or other data anlaysis software.
