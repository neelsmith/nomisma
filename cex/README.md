## Data sets

- `ocre-2019-12-04.cex` is the automated conversion of OCRE RDF data downloaded on Dec. 4, 2019. See th[is blog post]().
- `ocre-cite-ids.cex` is the same data set, but using ID values that are valid as object identifiers in CITE2 URNs.  The ID values differ from the last component of a nomisma.org in the following ways:
    - the identifier `9.alex.21B1.` was changed to `9.alex.21B.1`.
    - One empty record was manually removed.
    - in all identifiers, the hyphen '-' was changed to '_'


The file `ocre-url-cts-map.tsv` is a two-column tab-delimited file pairing full original URLs used as identifiers in OCRE to CTS URNs used by the nomisma library.

The file `ocre-url-cite2-map.tsv` is a two-column tab-delimited file pairing full original URLs used as identifiers in OCRE to CITE2 URNs used by the nomisma library to identify coins.
